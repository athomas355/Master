To Run the Code:
    ./master -t ss n 
        ss = time(default 100 secs)
        n = number of processes (default 20)
    
    -example: 
        ./master -t 100 5

Notes:
    -I wasn't able to finish the whole code.
    -I got it to fork a number of processes and write to cstest.
    -I had many days of issues with shared memory but I believe I got that to work but wasn't able to get to it in the code.
    - I will continue to work on it and possibly turn it in later if possible
